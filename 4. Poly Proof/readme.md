# ðŸ›¸ Polygon Courses (POLY PROOF: Advanced) 

This repository documents my progress and completion of advanced Polygon courses designed to deepen my knowledge of Web3, L2 scaling solutions, identity verification, and zero-knowledge proofs. Each course focuses on hands-on projects and real-world implementations on the Polygon network.

## ðŸš€ Courses Completed

### 1. **Polygon Proof of Stake**
- **ðŸ“˜ Description:**  
  Learned to **programmatically bridge an NFT collection** from Ethereum to Polygon using smart contracts and cross-chain communication.
- **ðŸ’¡ Skills Gained:**  
  - Ethereum â†” Polygon bridging  
  - NFT standards (ERC-721/ERC-1155)  
  - Cross-chain deployment  
  - Polygon PoS chain fundamentals

### 2. **Polygon ID**
- **ðŸ“˜ Description:**  
  Implemented an **end-to-end authentication system** using **Polygon ID**, a decentralized and private identity framework.
- **ðŸ’¡ Skills Gained:**  
  - DID (Decentralized Identity)  
  - Verifiable Credentials  
  - zkSNARKs for private authentication  
  - Web3 authentication workflows
