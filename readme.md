# 📚 MetaCrafters Blockchain Summer Internship Learning Journey

This repository documents my comprehensive learning journey through foundational and advanced blockchain development courses. Each course was designed to provide deep insights into Web3 technologies including NFT minting, Ethereum development, Solidity programming, and working with Avalanche and Polygon networks.

## 📘 1. JavaScript NFT Minting Course

**Course Objective**: Learn the fundamentals of NFTs using core JavaScript without relying on blockchain deployment. This course simulates how NFTs are minted, tracked, and managed using JavaScript objects and arrays.

### 🧠 Key Learnings:
- Understanding what NFTs are and how they work conceptually.
- Writing a `mintNFT()` function to create and store NFT metadata.
- Creating a function `listNFTs()` to iterate through NFTs and print their details.
- Implementing `getTotalSupply()` to track the number of NFTs created.
- Use of arrays, loops, functions, and object literals in JavaScript.

## 🔰 2. Solidity Beginner EVM Course (ETH PROOF)

**Course Objective**: Gain hands-on experience with Ethereum, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and writing smart contracts using Solidity. It serves as the foundation for blockchain developers.

### 🧠 Modules Covered:
1. **Getting Started with Web3 and the Blockchain**  
   - Introduction to blockchain, decentralization, DApps, wallets, and transactions.
   - Understand how blockchain networks differ from traditional systems.

2. **Ethereum and the EVM**  
   - Learn how Ethereum works, block creation, and transaction processing.
   - Explore how EVM executes smart contracts and how gas works.

3. **Getting Started with Solidity**  
   - Install and use Remix IDE.
   - Write simple smart contracts (e.g., counter, greeter).
   - Understand data types, visibility, modifiers, and state variables.
   - Learn about deployment, function calls, and interacting with the contract.

## ❄ 3. Avalanche Intermediate EVM Course (ETH + AVAX PROOF)

**Course Objective**: Expand knowledge on building and managing smart contracts in an EVM-compatible network like Avalanche. Learn advanced Solidity features and work with token standards.

### 🧠 Modules Covered:
1. **Functions and Errors – ETH + AVAX**  
   - Learn function types in Solidity: view, pure, payable, external, internal, etc.
   - Implement proper error handling with `require`, `assert`, and `revert`.

2. **Smart Contract Management – ETH + AVAX**  
   - Learn to deploy, upgrade, and interact with smart contracts on testnets.
   - Explore contract ownership, constructor patterns, and admin roles.

3. **Types of Functions – ETH + AVAX**  
   - Dive deeper into function modifiers, overloads, and access control.
   - Create and mint custom ERC-20/ERC-721 tokens.

4. **Building on Avalanche C-Chain**  
   - Configure Metamask and Remix to interact with Avalanche C-Chain.
   - Deploy and test Solidity contracts on Avalanche’s EVM-compatible network.

## 🔷 4. Polygon Advanced EVM Course (POLY PROOF)

**Course Objective**: Explore Polygon’s L2 architecture and tools such as zkEVM and Polygon ID. Build complex applications that incorporate identity verification, NFT bridging, and zero-knowledge proofs.

### 🧠 Modules Covered:
1. **Polygon Proof of Stake (PoS) Bridge**  
   - Learn to bridge assets/NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon using the PoS bridge.
   - Understand how to write scripts for token transfers across chains.

2. **Polygon ID**  
   - Set up decentralized identity using Polygon ID.
   - Build an end-to-end identity verification system using ZKPs.

3. **Polygon zkEVM**  
   - Understand the concept of zero-knowledge circuits.
   - Design a zkSNARK circuit and deploy an on-chain verifier using Polygon zkEVM.
