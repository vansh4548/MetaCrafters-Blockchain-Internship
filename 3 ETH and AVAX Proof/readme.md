# ðŸ§Š Avalanche Courses (ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course)

This repository documents my journey through the **ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course** series, focusing on smart contract development, deployment, and management on both Ethereum and Avalanche (C-Chain). These hands-on modules provided in-depth experience with Solidity and Avalanche's EVM-compatible environment.
